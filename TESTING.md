### Bugs
#### Fixed:
- I was getting an UnboundLocalError at /products/, to fix this I added categories = Noneto the all_products view.

- The bag quantity was only updating by â‚¬1 instead of the full amount of the product. After lloking into it I had a + instead of * in the contexts.

- Crispy forms not was working bootstrap 5/field.html. To fix this I installed cripsy-bootstrap 5, but have since changed to Bootstrap 4.

- Images were their original size and not matching. This was fixed using aspect ratio in css.

- The footer had two white blocks on either side in the order confirmation. To fix this all that was needed was en extra closing div.


#### Unfixed:
- The add to favourites button would not fill in when a user added the product to their favourites. To add a temporary fix this I added a toast to let the user know the product had been added to their favourites. I would like to go back and change it in the future to have the icon empty and then fill when added.

- Webhook resulting in a 500 internal error. During testing when the payment flow is interupted, the payment is going through but the order not being saved. I'm still not sure what the problem is as I've tried to log into Heroku through gitpod terminal but due to two step verification it won't allow me to log in to see what the exact error is, I've also deleted webhook secret codes, and rewrote the code all again and the problem is still persiting. The webhook returns status 200 when the payment flow is not interupted.
